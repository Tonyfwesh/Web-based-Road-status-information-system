     Punky Bakeries was founded in 2012 when Noskinpain Abubarkar turned her passion
      for baking into a business. While in management consulting, she decided it was
       time to leave a job she liked and face the life she loves. The business was 
       formerly known as Everything Nuts specializing in cookies, brownies, and muffins.
       Customers fell in love, word got out and requests for cakes started rolling in.
     Over the years, the business has grown from a bakery with just a few products, to
      one producing a wide variety of products, and has still been able to hold on to 
      its original ethicss of using only the finest ingredients in baking. Thus, whether 
      you’re looking for an extra special birthday or wedding cake, a cheesecake to top
       off a dinner party, or just fancy some office treats, we’re ready to spice up your day
